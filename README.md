# ghsprint

ghsprint is a Python library to simplify boring tasks of the sprint, like generating the report for sprint review. It fetches all stories from the given project board, detects which ones were pokered (they received labels with numbers in a certain time frame), detects which ones were repokered, detects what pull-requests relate to them, and detects pull-requests of that week. Finally it outputs an markdown-formatted text for copy-pasting. It takes around 20 seconds to generate a report.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install ghsprint.

```bash
pip install ghsprint
```

## Usage

```bash
python -m ghsprint --special-tags "on hold" --ignore-columns "Product Backlog" --login-name-mapper alxndrjhn:Alex,strenge:Robin --keep-columns "In Progress" ae71abf4f9a41cbb6af0005de932e265614f6a317c7 Storyboard company/some-service company/someLabel company/some_extraction
```

`--ignore-columns`

`-v` verbosity level, if not given, only the report and errors will be printed to stdout, with `-v` warnings will be printed as well, with `-vv` info messages and with `-vvv` debug messages

`-w` or `--week` is the calender week-number, if not given, the current week will be used. Example: `--week 6` will generate the report for the 6th week of the current year.
